# Test Front-end Servipar

A simple nextjs app

## Install

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

## How to login/register?

I left a default login configured :

- email: bruno@email.com
- password: bruno

just click on "Login" and be redirected to "/home"

If you prefer to choose another user, just use one of these credentials below:

```bash
{ "id": 1, "email": "bruno@email.com", "password": "bruno" },
{ "id": 2, "email": "techie@email.com", "password": "techie" },
{ "id": 3, "email": "nilson@email.com", "password": "nilson" },
{ "id": 4, "email": "nilson1@email.com", "password": "nilson" },
{ "id": 5, "email": "nilson2@email.com", "password": "nilson" },
{ "id": 6, "email": "nilson3@email.com", "password": "nilson" },
{ "id": 7, "email": "nilson4@email.com", "password": "nilson" },
{ "id": 8, "email": "nilson7@email.com", "password": "nilson" },
{ "id": 9, "email": "nilson8@email.com", "password": "nilson" },
```

## Sort and Add Products

To order the products, just click on the headings of each column, such as "nome", "preÃ§o", etc...

To add products to the list just click on the bottom left button "Adicionar Produto", this will open a Modal with a form; Fill in the fields correctly and click "Cadastrar".

## Change page and change the listing limit

To change pages it is necessary to click on the buttons arranged in the lower right corner of the page (they will be visible if there is more than 1 page to be shown).

To change the limit it is necessary to click on the "limit" selector and select the limit according to your preference

## Produts Report

To have access to the products report you need to be logged in with the email user "bruno@email.com", only he will have access to the report.
